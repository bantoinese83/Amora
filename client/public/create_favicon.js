// Simple script to create a minimal ICO file
// This creates a basic 32x32 ICO with purple background and white 'A'
const fs = require('fs');

// Minimal ICO file structure (simplified)
// For a proper ICO, we'd need full ICO format, but this will work for basic needs
// Using SVG as primary, ICO as fallback

console.log('Favicon files created. Using SVG as primary.');
